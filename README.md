## Circuit Diagram

<p>Knowing how the parts fit together is crucial before beginning the assembling process. A condensed circuit diagram that shows how each component works together is shown below. To guarantee correct operation, carefully follow this diagram. In this circuit diagram, an Arduino UNO is used as a microcontroller. A L293D motor driver is used that drives four dc motors. Two IR sensors are used to detect any obstacle on the way. Two cells of 3.7 volts are used as a power source. A power on/off switch is used. Output of the IR sensors are connected to A0 and A1 pin of the Arduino UNO.</p>
